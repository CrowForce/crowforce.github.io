            <h2 id="background-problem">The Problem</h2>
            <p>Over our first three competitions, team 10809 Crow Force sacrificed points during
            autonomous and tele-op when our robot became disoriented, causing failures in autonomous
            trajectory sequences and field-centric driver control. These failures seemed to coincide
            with collisions between exposed metal on our robot and other conductive objects on the
            field such as the 2023-'24 CENTERSTAGE™ game's truss supports and other robots.</p>

            <p>By finding a way to reproduce failures with truss contact and then printing Inertial
            Measurement Unit (IMU) orientation telemetry to the driver hub, we observed our
            gyroscope and accelerometer readings drop to all zeros after metal contact that would
            persist until repowering the robot. After reading
            <a href="https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/managing_esd/managing-esd.html">FIRST's
            article “Managing Electrostatic Discharge Effects”</a>, we learned that these IMU
            flatlines could result from ESD: electrostatic discharge. The
            <a href="https://firsttechchallenge.blogspot.com/2023/11/unexpected-imu-reset.html">FIRST
            Tech Challenge Blog's 2023-11-21 post “Unexpected IMU Reset”</a> lead us to suspect REV

            IMU hardware changes</a> made to <a href="https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1595/">REV-31-1595
            Control Hubs</a>. We tested this hypothesis by switching our robot's control hub with an
            older model and observing a reduction in IMU resets. Unfortunately, older generation
            control hubs are a luxury of established teams and they won't survive the playfield
            forever.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> To determine which type of IMU your control hub contains
            without knowing its manufacture date, see the control hub's web interface as explained
            by <a href="https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/sensors/i2c/imu#how-to-use">REV's
            IMU documentation</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="background-existing-solutions">Existing Solutions</h2>
            <p>If your robot suffers from similar <abbr title="Inertial Measurement Unit">IMU</abbr>
            issues or other electrical failures that might be caused by
            <abbr title="Electrostatic Discharge">ESD</abbr>, try these existing solutions first.
            Combine them to build up “defense in depth”, layering redundant protections that are
            less likely to all fail at once.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Add a <a href="https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1269/">REV-31-1269
                    Resistive Grounding Strap</a> between a spare XT30 connector and the metal
                    chassis of your robot. The bump in the middle of this wire hides a resistor that
                    lets accumulated electric charge safely trickle from the metal frame into your
                    control and expansion hubs, lowering the voltage (difference in density of
                    electric charge) between them.</p>

                    <p>Keep in mind that most extruded aluminum channel is “anodized”: coated in a
                    non-conductive layer to prevent corrosion. Cut through it with a star washer or
                    by scraping to make good electrical contact between the grounding strap's ring
                    terminal and your robot's frame.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Cover exposed metal along the outside of your robot with an electrically
                insulating material where it could touch the truss or other robots. Metal-to-metal
                contact would allow electric charge to rush in or out of your robot's frame to
                balance with the other object.</p></li>

                <li><p>Also cover any visible metal on wiring connectors and empty sockets with
                electrically insulating material like electrical tape. When the voltage between your
                robot's frame and its wiring grows too high, electricity can jump <em>through the
                air</em> one centimeter or more as a visible spark; This is the discharge of
                electricity that ESD refers to.</p></li>

                <li><p>Update to REV's early-access Control Hub OS version 1.1.4 or newer, which
                claims to reduce the chance of IMU resets.
                <a href="https://firsttechchallenge.blogspot.com/2024/02/first-tech-challenge-sdk-and-rev.html">This
                FIRST Tech Challenge Blog post from 2024-02-24</a> explains how to install the

            <p>Once your team has applied the previous suggestions for mitigating static, your new
            control hub's IMU may <em>still</em> reset when shocked. Fortunately, external IMU
            sensor boards using the same chip as original control hubs can still be purchased! Read
            on for a simple guide to buying, assembling, attaching, and configuring a replacement
            IMU in a 3D-printed enclosure designed by team 10809 Crow Force and the mentors of Sage
            Creek High School.</p>

            <p>It is very easy to get your external IMU to talk to your robot controller. Below are
            instructions on how to configure the external IMU using your connected driver
            station.</p>

            <h3 id="software-driver-station-disable-internal-imu">Disable Internal IMU</h3>
            <p>First, disable the built-in internal IMUs from your control hub using a connected
            driver station:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>At the driver station's main screen, tap the three-dots button at the top
                    right and select “Configure Robot”.</p>

                    connected peripherals are “Analog Input Devices”, “I2C Bus 0”, “I2C Bus 1”, “I2C

                    channel. The control hub's internal IMU is hardwired to this I2C bus.</p>

                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Do not</em> add your external IMU on this I2C bus,
                    since the unified <code>IMU</code> interface code for reading measurements will
                    ignore your configuration and try to talk to the original internal IMU instead.

                    adding your external IMU to a different I2C bus.</p>
