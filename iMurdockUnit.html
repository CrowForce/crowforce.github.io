            <h2 id="background-problem">The Problem</h2>
            <p>Over our first three competitions, team 10809 Crow Force sacrificed points during
            autonomous and tele-op when our robot became disoriented, causing failures in autonomous
            trajectory sequences and field-centric driver control. These failures seemed to coincide
            with collisions between exposed metal on our robot and other conductive objects on the
            field such as the 2023-'24 CENTERSTAGE™ game's truss supports and other robots.</p>

            <p>By finding a way to reproduce failures with truss contact and then printing Inertial
            Measurement Unit (IMU) orientation telemetry to the driver hub, we observed our
            gyroscope and accelerometer readings drop to all zeros after metal contact that would
            persist until repowering the robot. After reading
            <a href="https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/managing_esd/managing-esd.html"
            >FIRST's article “Managing Electrostatic Discharge Effects”</a>, we learned that these
            IMU flatlines could result from ESD: electrostatic discharge. The
            <a href="https://firsttechchallenge.blogspot.com/2023/11/unexpected-imu-reset.html"
            >FIRST Tech Challenge Blog's 2023-11-21 post “Unexpected IMU Reset”</a> lead us to
            suspect REV Robotics'

            <a href="https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1595/">REV-31-1595 Control Hubs</a>. We
            tested this hypothesis by switching our robot's control hub with an older model and
            observing a reduction in IMU resets. Unfortunately, older generation control hubs are a
            luxury of established teams and they won't survive the playfield forever.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> To determine which type of IMU your control hub contains
            without knowing its manufacture date, see the control hub's web interface as explained
            by <a href="https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/sensors/i2c/imu#how-to-use">REV's
            IMU documentation</a>.</p>

            <p>If your robot suffers from similar <abbr title="Inertial Measurement Unit">IMU</abbr>
            issues or other electrical failures that might be caused by
            <abbr title="Electrostatic Discharge">ESD</abbr>, try these existing solutions first.
            Combine them to build up “defense in depth”, layering redundant protections that are
            less likely to all fail at once.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Add a <a href="https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1269/">REV-31-1269
                    Resistive Grounding Strap</a> between a spare XT30 connector and the metal
                    chassis of your robot. The bump in the middle of this wire hides a resistor that
                    lets accumulated electric charge safely trickle from the metal frame into your
                    control and expansion hubs, lowering the voltage (difference in density of
                    electric charge) between them.</p>

                    <p>Keep in mind that most extruded aluminum channel is “anodized”: coated in a
                    non-conductive layer to prevent corrosion. Cut through it with a star washer or
                    by scraping to make good electrical contact between the grounding strap's ring
                    terminal and your robot's frame.</p>

                    ring terminal fastened to aluminum extrusion, with a toothed lock washer in
                    between that has scratched through the extrusion's anodized coating.">
                </li>
                <li><p>Cover exposed metal along the outside of your robot with an electrically
                insulating material where it could touch the truss or other robots. Metal-to-metal
                contact would allow electric charge to rush in or out of your robot's frame to
                balance with the other object.</p></li>

                <li><p>Also cover any visible metal on wiring connectors and empty sockets with
                electrically insulating material like electrical tape. When the voltage between your
                robot's frame and its wiring grows too high, electricity can jump <em>through the
                air</em> one centimeter or more as a visible spark; This is the discharge of
                electricity that ESD refers to.</p></li>

                <li><p>Update to REV's early-access Control Hub OS version 1.1.4 or newer, which
                claims to reduce the chance of IMU resets.

            <h2 id="background-our-solution">Our Solution</h2>
            <p>Once your team has applied the previous suggestions for mitigating static, your new
            control hub's IMU may <em>still</em> reset when shocked. Fortunately, external IMU
            sensor boards using the same chip as original control hubs can still be purchased!
            <a href="#hardware">Read on</a> for a simple guide to buying, assembling, attaching, and
            configuring a replacement IMU in a 3D-printed enclosure designed by team 10809 Crow
            Force and the mentors of Sage Creek High School.</p>

                the internal IMU without code changes, and accelerometer readings will only vary
                slightly while rotating.</p></li>

            <p>The code below shows how to setup your new IMU. Make the name of your imu matches the
            name in IC Bus 2 slot on your drive hub. Another thing to note is the Orientation we
            have given about our IMU. This changes depending on how you have your external IMU
            positioned.</p>
