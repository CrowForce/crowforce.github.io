                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <h3>We are one of five teams from Sage Creek High School!</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi! Weâ€™re a robotics team based at Sage Creek High School (Carlsbad, CA) that competes in First Tech Challenge (FTC) robotics competitions. FTC is a robotics competition for  students in grades 7-12 to compete head to head by designing, building, and programming a robot to compete against other teams in an alliance format. Through these competitions, FTC inspires students to pursue a STEM-related career and teaches them leadership, teamwork, and critical thinking skills. Our robotics team was established in 2015 as the "Amateur Optimists" however it quickly changed in 2016; they decided that it was time for a name change to really fit their personalities and team dynamic. The original team consisted of 5 members, these 5 members watched a video in class about crows technical smarts and problem solving abilities. So, from 2016 to 2018 we were known as "Crow Force Five". Finally, in 2018 with the addition of many new members the team name was changed to "Crow Force". We also had a colour change from grey, white, black and teal to our current team colours, red and black.
