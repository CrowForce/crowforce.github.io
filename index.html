                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <h3>We are one of five teams from Sage Creek High School!</h3>
                <p>
                    Our robotics team was established in 2015 as the "Amateur Optimists" however it quickly changed in 2016; they decided that it was time for a name change to really fit their personalities and team dynamic. The original team consisted of 5 members, these 5 members watched a video in class about crows technical smarts and problem solving abilities. So, from 2016 to 2018 we were known as "Crow Force Five".
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    Finally, in 2018 with the addition of many new members the team name was changed to "Crow Force". We also had a colour change from grey, white, black and teal to our current team colours, red and black.
